My attempt at creating a [Weapon of Math Destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_of_Math_Destruction)

### What's in store
There's a Jupyter notebook with some preliminary analysis, a Shiny app to to some simple 2D plots based off the data, and a small Flask app (in progress) you can shoot at with your own data to see if you'd have been accepted by the Mighty Model.

### Comments and limitations
You can't reduce a person to their exam results (although this is precisely what we do as a society when it comes to university enrolment).
Predicting whether someone is going to graduate based off just their entry results is going to be, on a single person basis, just about as accurate as flipping a coin.
Nevertheless, it's fun.
